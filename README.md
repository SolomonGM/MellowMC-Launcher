# MellowMC Launcher

Project: Custom Minecraft Launcher

## Description:
Develop a custom Minecraft launcher using C# that provides additional features beyond the standard Minecraft launcher. This launcher will allow users to manage multiple Minecraft profiles, mods, and configurations easily.

## Features:

### Profile Management:

+ Allow users to create, edit, and delete Minecraft profiles.
+ Each profile should store information such as selected Minecraft version, installed mods, and other configurations.

### Mod Integration:

+ Provide a user-friendly interface for users to manage and install Minecraft mods.
+ Allow users to enable or disable mods for each profile.

### Version Selection:

+ Implement a feature to select different Minecraft versions for each profile.
+ Download and store Minecraft versions locally for offline play.

### News Feed:

+ Display Minecraft-related news, updates, and announcements within the launcher.
+ Fetch and display information from the official Minecraft website or other relevant sources.

### Settings and Configurations:

+ Allow users to customize launcher settings, such as memory allocation, Java path, and other launch parameters.
+ Implement an option to set custom JVM arguments.

### Authentication:

+ Integrate Minecraft account authentication to allow users to log in with their Mojang accounts.
+ Securely store and manage authentication tokens.

### Launcher Theme Customization:

+ Provide users with the ability to customize the appearance of the launcher through themes.
+ Allow users to create or download themes for personalization.

### Console Output:

+ Display the Minecraft game console output directly within the launcher for easier debugging and troubleshooting.

### Technologies:

+ C# for the desktop application.
+ WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface.
+ JSON for configuration file storage.
+ Minecraft API for version and profile management.
+ Networking libraries for authentication.

### Additional Challenges:

+ Implement error handling and logging for better user experience.
+ Consider adding an auto-update feature for the launcher itself.
